Dear fellow Californian,
Whether traveling by car, transit, bike, scooter,
skateboard or on foot, we all want to reach our
destination safely. Tragically, many Californians do
not.
Since 2010, more than 30,000 people have been
killed and another 100,000 people seriously
injured on California roads. This deadly trend
is getting worse, especially for people walking or biking. We’ve seen
a nearly 50 percent rise in annual deaths and serious injuries for
pedestrians and greater than 60 percent increase in bicyclists killed per
year since 2010.
Unlike those of us traveling in vehicles with seat belts, airbags and other
safety features, people outside of vehicles don’t have the same level
of protection and are more vulnerable every time they are on the road.
Their safety must always be top of mind when we’re driving.
California is doing everything possible to implement comprehensive
traffic safety measures to eliminate deaths and serious injuries on our
roadways. It includes strategies to reduce our dependence on driving,
to the way we design roads and intersections, to expanding safe walking
and biking options.
But we need your help. Without all of us practicing safe driving habits,
these avoidable tragedies will continue to occur. Please make sure to
buckle up, follow all traffic laws, pay extra attention to pedestrians and
bicyclists, and do not drive if you’re distracted or impaired.
I hope the information in this California Driver’s Handbook can help
everyone on the road – drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians – reach their
destination safely. Because it’s about more than just learning the rules of
the roads. It could be a matter of life and death.
Wishing you safe journeys,
Toks Omishakin
Secretary
California State Transportation Agency

SECTION 3. The Testing Process
Driver’s License Tests
Here is an overview of the driver’s license tests:
1. Vision Test
DMV tests all applicants to ensure they can see well enough to drive
safely. If you take your vision test with corrective or contact lenses,
your driver’s license will have a corrective lenses restriction. If you do
not pass your vision test, you will be asked to have your eye doctor
complete a Report of Vision Examination form. For more information, visit
dmv.ca.gov/vision-standards.
2. Knowledge Test
When you apply for an original driver’s license, you must pass a
knowledge test with multiple choice questions. You are allowed three
attempts to pass before you must reapply. Minors must wait seven days
to retake a failed knowledge test, not including the day of the failure.
Testing options will be available once you complete your application at
dmv.ca.gov/dl.
IMPORTANT: You are not allowed to use any testing aids during
knowledge tests, such as a California Driver’s Handbook or cell phone.
3. Behind-the-Wheel Drive Test
When you apply for an original driver’s license, you will be tested on your
ability to safely drive a vehicle. Upon renewal, drivers with a vision or
medical condition may be required to take a behind-the-wheel test. The
examiner may give two or more instructions at one time to determine
whether you can understand and properly follow both directions.
For example, “At the next street, make a left turn, and then at the first
intersection make another left turn.”
Visit dmv.ca.gov/make-an-appointment to schedule a behind-the-
wheel drive test appointment.

examiner may give two or more instructions at one time to determine

For example, “At the next street, make a left turn, and then at the first
intersection make another left turn.”
Visit dmv.ca.gov/make-an-appointment to schedule a behind-the-
wheel drive test appointment.
7
On the day of your behind-the-wheel test, you must bring:
1. Your instruction permit or driver’s license (if you have one).
2. Another California-licensed driver who is at least 18 years old (25 for
minors), unless you are already licensed to drive.
3. A vehicle that is safe to drive for your test.
4. Valid proof of insurance and vehicle registration.
5. If you plan to use a rental vehicle for your drive test, your name must
be listed on the rental contract. The contract must not exclude
behind-the-wheel drive tests.
NOTE: Minors must wait 14 days to retake a failed behind-the-wheel
drive test, not including the day of the failure.
Before you begin, the DMV examiner will ask you to locate and
demonstrate the following:
• Driver window – The window on the driver side must open.
• Windshield – The windshield must allow a full, clear, unblocked view
for you and the DMV examiner. Windshield cracks may postpone your
test.
• Rear-view mirrors – At least two rearview mirrors. One of them must
be on the left side of your vehicle.
• Brake lights – The right and left brake lights must be operational.
• Tires – The tires must have at least 1/32-inch of uniformed tread
depth. The use of a donut tire is not allowed during a drive test.
• Foot brake – There must be at least one inch of clearance between
the bottom of the brake pedal and the floorboard when depressed.
• Horn – Designed for the vehicle, in proper working condition, and
loud enough to be heard from a distance of at least 200 feet.
• Emergency (parking brake) – How to set and release the parking
brake.
• Turn/Arm signals
a. Left turn.
b. Right turn.
c. Slowing down or stopping.
• Windshield wipers: control arm or switch – You may be required to
show they function.
• Seat belts – All seat belts must work properly and be used by the
individual(s) in the vehicle.
NOTE: If your vehicle does not meet the requirements, your drive test
will be rescheduled.
8
Interpreters may be used during the pre-drive inspection for the
identification and use of certain controls in the vehicle but may not
accompany you during the drive test.
Only the examiner is allowed to accompany you during the drive test.
Exceptions are made for training, service animals, and certain law
enforcement situations.
The use of a recording device, including a video recorder, is prohibited
during a behind-the-wheel drive test. If the recording device cannot be
powered off or disabled, the applicant must block it so there is no visual
or audio recording during the drive test.
Other Things to Know for Your Behind-the-Wheel Test
The drive test is intended to determine your skill in operating a motor
vehicle in most road situations and evaluate your abilities, not the
vehicle’s technology. Therefore, advanced driver assistance systems
technologies, such as automated parallel parking, lane departure, and
adaptive cruise control, are not permitted during the drive test. Vehicle
safety technology, such as backup cameras and blind spot monitors, may
be used on the drive test, but are not a replacement for an actual visual
check of your mirrors and blind spots.

dmv.ca.gov/dlservices.
Change Your Address
If you move, you must notify DMV of your new address within ten days.
Submit a change of address online at dmv.ca.gov/addresschange or
by mail. It is your responsibility to ensure DMV has your correct mailing
address on record.
You do not automatically get a new driver’s license when you change
your address. You may request a replacement for a fee.
Replace or Renew Your Driver’s License
It is against the law to drive with an expired driver’s license. To
renew or replace a lost, stolen, or damaged driver’s license, visit
dmv.ca.gov/dlservices, or DMV office.
Before DMV can issue you a driver’s license, you may need to provide
additional proof of your identity. Your driver’s license and identity
document may expire on the same date. If so, you will be required to
provide a valid identity document. If you are a minor, your parent or
guardian must sign the application. Once you receive your replacement
card, your old card is no longer valid. If you find the old card, destroy it.
Extend Your Driver’s License
If you are out-of-state and cannot renew, you may request a one
year extension of your driver’s license. Before your driver’s license
expires, submit a request with your name, driver’s license number,
birth date, California residence address, and out-of-state address to
dl-extensions@dmv.ca.gov.
NOTE: Limited-term driver’s licenses are not eligible for this extension.

SECTION 5. An Introduction to Driving
Your health may affect your driving.
Vision – You must be able to notice hazards in different types of lighting,
judge distances, adjust to traffic speed, and read road signs.
Hearing – You must be able to hear horns, sirens, motorcycles, or
screeching tires that may alert you of hazards. It is illegal to wear a
headset or earplugs in both ears while driving.
Fatigue and Drowsiness – Can affect your vision and increase reaction
time to hazards.
Physical and Mental – You must be alert to quickly decide the correct
course of action in any type of traffic situation, including unexpected
ones.
Medications – Prescription and over-the-counter medications can make
you an unsafe driver. Some medicines can make you sleepy. It is your
responsibility to know the effects of the medications you take.
Health – Physicians are required to report patients, who are at least 14
years old, to DMV if they believe you have medical conditions that may
affect your ability to drive safely, such as lapse of consciousness.
Controlling the Vehicle
To control your vehicle, it is critical to keep both hands on the wheel
whenever possible.
Hand-to-Hand Steering
To use this steering wheel method:
1. Start with your hands at 9 and 3 o’clock or 8 and 4 o’clock.
2. Do not cross your hands over the middle of the steering wheel.
3. Keep your hands in these positions, even when making turns.
12
Hand-Over-Hand Steering
Use this steering wheel method when you turn at low speeds, park, or
need to recover from a skid. To use this method:
1. Start with your hands at 8 and 4 o’clock.
2. Reach across the steering wheel to grasp the opposite side.
3. Let go of the steering wheel with your other hand.
4. Reach across the arm still holding the wheel, grip the wheel, and pull
up.
One-Hand Steering
There are only two situations that may require steering with one hand:
• When you are turning while backing up to see where you are going
behind you. Place your hand at the 12 o’clock position on the steering
wheel.
• When you are operating vehicle controls that require you to remove a
hand from the steering wheel.
Signals, Horns, And Headlights
Your signals, horn, and headlights are important for communicating with
other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
Signaling
Always signal when you turn, change lanes, slow down, or stop.
You can signal using your vehicle’s signal lights or using hand-and-arm
positions. Bicyclists may signal a turn with their arm held straight out,
pointing in the direction they plan to turn.
Left Turn Right Turn Slow or Stop
13
You should signal:
• At least 100 feet before you turn.
• Before every lane change.
• At least five seconds before you change lanes on a freeway.
• Before pulling next to the curb or away from the curb.
• Even when you do not see other vehicles around you.
• When you are almost through the intersection if you plan to turn
shortly after crossing the intersection.
Remember to turn off your signal when you no longer need it.
Using Your Horn
Use your vehicle’s horn to let other drivers know you are there or warn
others of a hazard. Use your horn to:
• Avoid collisions.
• Alert oncoming traffic on narrow mountain roads where you cannot
see at least 200 feet ahead.
Using Your Headlights
Your vehicle’s headlights help you see what is in front of you. They also
make it easier for other drivers to see your vehicle. Dim your high-beam
headlights to low beams within 500 feet of a vehicle coming toward you
or within 300 feet of a vehicle you are following. It is illegal to drive using
only parking lights. Use your headlights:
• When it is too dark to see from 1,000 feet away.
• Beginning 30 minutes after sunset.
• Until 30 minutes before sunrise.
• In adverse weather. If you need to use your windshield wipers due to
fog, rain, or snow, you must turn on your low-beam headlights.
• When conditions (such as clouds, dust, smoke, or fog) prevent you
from seeing other vehicles.
• On mountain roads and tunnels (even on sunny days).
• When a road sign states that headlights must be on.
• To help other drivers see your vehicle, especially when the sun is low
on the horizon.
14
Using Your Emergency Flashers
If you can see a collision or hazard ahead, warn drivers behind you using
these methods:
• Turn on your emergency flashers.
• Lightly tap your brake pedal three or four times.
• Use a hand signal when slowing and stopping.
If you need to stop because of vehicle trouble:
• Turn on your emergency flashers. If your vehicle does not have
emergency flashers, use your turn signals.
• If possible, pull off the road away from all traffic.
• If you cannot get completely off the road, stop where people can see
you and your vehicle from behind.
• Do not stop just over a hill or just around a curve. Other drivers may
not see your vehicle in time to avoid a collision.
• Call for emergency roadside assistance and stay in your vehicle until
help arrives.
15
SECTION 6. Navigating the Roads
Traffic Lanes
A traffic lane is a section of road for a single line of traffic.
Lane Markings
Lane markings on road surfaces help drivers know which part of the road
to use and understand traffic rules.
Single Solid Yellow Line
A single solid yellow line marks the center of a road with two-way traffic.
Do not pass a vehicle in front of you if there is only one lane of traffic
going your direction and a solid yellow line on your side of the road.
Double Solid Yellow Lines
Do not pass over double solid
yellow lines. Stay to the right of
these lines unless you are:
• In a high-occupancy vehicle
(HOV) carpool lane that has a
designated entrance on the
left.
• Instructed by construction or other signs to drive on the other side of
the road because your side is closed or blocked.
• Turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter or exit a
driveway or private road or make a U-turn.
Two sets of solid double yellow lines spaced two or more feet apart are
considered a barrier. Do not drive on or over this barrier, make a left turn,
or make a U-turn across it, except at designated openings.
Broken Yellow Line
A broken yellow line indicates you may pass if the broken line is next to
your driving lane. Only pass when it is safe.
Single Solid White Line
A single solid white line marks traffic lanes going in the same direction.
This includes one-way streets.
16
Double Solid White Lines
Double solid white lines indicate a lane barrier between a regular use
and a preferential use lane, such as a carpool (HOV) lane. You may also
see double solid white lines in or near freeway on and off ramps. Never
change lanes over double solid white lines. Wait until you see a single
broken white line.
Broken White Lines
Broken white lines separate traffic lanes on roads with two or more lanes
in the same direction.
End of Lane Markings
Ending freeway and street lanes are usually
marked with large broken lines. If you are
driving in a lane marked with broken lines, be
prepared to exit the freeway or for the lane
to end. Look for a sign that tells you to exit or
merge.
Yield Line
A yield line is a solid white line of triangles
that shows approaching vehicles where to
yield or stop. The triangles point towards
approaching vehicles.
17
Choosing a Lane
:
Traffic lanes are often
referred to by number. The
left (or fast) lane is called the
Number 1 Lane. The lane to
the right of the Number 1
Lane is called the Number 2 Lane. Then the Number 3 Lane, etc.
Here are some tips for choosing a lane
• Use the left lane to pass or turn left.
• Use the right lane to enter or exit traffic.
Changing Lanes
Before you change lanes:
• Signal.
• Check your mirrors.
• Check traffic behind and beside you.
• Look over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move to make
sure the lane is clear.
• Check your blind spots for other vehicles, motorcyclists, and
bicyclists. Do not let the vehicle drift into another lane.
• Be sure there is enough space for your vehicle in the next lane. It is
not necessary to slow down before a lane change.
Stay in one lane as much as possible. Do not weave in and out of traffic.
Last minute lane or direction changes may increase the risk of collisions.
Once you start moving through an intersection, keep going. If you start
to make a turn, follow through. If you miss a turn, keep driving until you
can safely and legally turn around.
Types of Lanes
Passing Lanes
On a multilane road, the passing lane (far left lane) is the lane closest to
the center divider and is used to pass other vehicles.
Carpool/High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes
An HOV lane is a special lane reserved for carpools, buses,
motorcycles, or low-emission vehicles with decals. To use an
HOV lane, one of these must apply:
Example of numbered traffic lanes.
18
• You have a certain number of people in your vehicle. There will be
signs at the on-ramp or along the road to tell you the minimum
number of people. Road signs also list the hours when the HOV rules
apply.
• You are driving a low emission or zero emission vehicle. You must
display a special DMV-issued decal.
• You are riding a motorcycle (unless otherwise posted).
The road surface in a HOV lane is marked with a diamond symbol and
the words Carpool Lane. Do not cross over double solid lines to enter or
exit an HOV lane. Use designated entrances and exits.
Center Left Turn Lanes
:
A center left turn lane is located in the middle of a two-way street. It is
marked on both sides by two painted lines. The inner line is broken and
the outer line is solid. Use the center left turn lane to prepare for and
make a left turn or U-turn. It is not a regular traffic lane or passing lane.
You may only drive for 200 feet in the center left turn lane. To turn left
from this lane
• Look for other vehicles
coming toward you in the
center left turn lane.
• Signal.
• Look over your shoulder to
check your blind spots.
• Merge completely into the center left turn lane so you do not block
traffic.
• Turn when it is safe.
Turnout Areas or Lanes
Some two-lane roads have special turnout areas or lanes.
Merge into these areas or lanes to allow cars behind you to
pass.
You must use a turnout area or lane to let other vehicles
pass when you are driving slowly on a two-lane road, where
passing is unsafe, and there are five or more vehicles following you.

Bicycle Lanes
Bicycle lanes are for bicyclists only and run alongside vehicle traffic.
They are typically marked by a single solid white line and signs. They are
sometimes painted bright green to make them easier to see.
It is illegal to drive in a bicycle lane unless you are:
• Parking (where permitted).
• Entering or leaving the road.
• Turning (within 200 feet of an intersection).
There are multiple types of bike lanes and markings:
• Bike lane: Established along streets adjacent to vehicle traffic.
Typically marked by a single solid white line that turns into a dash-line
near an intersection.
• Buffered bike lane: Uses chevrons or diagonal markings to provide
greater separation from traffic and on-street parking.
• Bike route: Uses bike route signs and shared road markings to
designate a preferred route for bicyclists on streets shared with
vehicle traffic.
• Bicycle boulevard: Prioritizes bicycle travel on streets shared with
vehicle traffic.
• Separated bikeway: Is physically separated from motor vehicle traffic
and for exclusive use of bicyclists. They are also known as a cycle
track or protected bike lanes. The separation may include flexible
posts, grade separation, inflexible barriers, or on-street parking.
• Shared roadway bicycle markings: Alert
drivers that bicyclists can occupy the lane
and help bicyclists maintain a safe lane
position in traffic.
NOTE: Check your blind spots before entering
a bike lane. If you drive a motorized bicycle,
use caution to avoid other bicyclists. Travel at
a reasonable speed and do not endanger the
safety of other bicyclists.

Turns
Right Turns
To make a right turn:
• Drive close to the right edge of the
road.
— If a designated right turn lane is
available, enter at the opening.
— You can drive in a bike lane
within 200 feet from the turn. Check for bicyclists in your blind
spots.
• Watch for pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists between your
vehicle and the curb.
• Start signaling about 100 feet before the turn.
• Look over your right shoulder and reduce your speed.
• Stop behind the limit line. A limit line is a wide white line that shows
the drivers where to stop before an intersection or crosswalk. If there
is no limit line, stop before you enter the crosswalk. If there is no
crosswalk, stop before you enter the intersection.
• Look both ways (left-right-left) and turn when it is safe.
• Complete your turn in the right lane. Do not turn wide into another
lane.
Right Turn Against a Red Light
You may turn right at a red light after a complete stop unless there is a
No Turn on Red sign. Follow the same steps listed above for right turns.
Right Turn Against a Red Arrow
You may not turn right if you are stopped at a red arrow light. Wait until
the light changes to green before making your turn.
Right Turn at a Public Transit Bus Lane
It is illegal to drive, stop, park, or leave a vehicle in an area designated for
public transit buses. Signs will be posted to indicate the lanes are for bus
only use. However, you may cross a bus lane to make a right turn.
Example of a right turn.
21
Right Turn onto a Road with a Dedicated Lane
A dedicated right turn lane does not
merge into another lane and allows you
to make a right turn without stopping.
You may make your turn even if there
is a red light for vehicles going straight
through the intersection. If there is a
traffic light or sign on the right curb of
the right turn lane, you must obey that
light or sign. Always yield to pedestrians
in a crosswalk when turning.
Left Turns
To turn left:
• Drive close to the center divider or
into the left turn lane.
— Enter a designated left turn
lane at the opening. Do not
cross any solid line.
— Enter a two-way center left turn lane within 200 feet of the turn.
Respect the right-of-way of any vehicle, bicyclist, or motorcyclist
already in the lane. Always yield to pedestrians.
• Start signaling 100 feet before the turn.
• Look over your left shoulder and reduce your speed.
• Stop behind the limit line. If there is no limit line, stop before you
enter the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, stop before you enter the
intersection.
• Look both ways (left-right-left) and begin your turn when it is safe.
• Proceed into the intersection while turning to complete your turn in
the left lane.
• Do not turn the steering wheel too soon and enter the lane of
oncoming vehicles.
— Keep your wheels pointed straight ahead until it is safe to start
your turn. If your wheels are pointed to the left and a vehicle hits
you from behind, you could be pushed into oncoming traffic.
• Accelerate smoothly during and after the turn.
• Allow the steering wheel to straighten in the new lane.
Example of a left turn.
22
Left Turn Against a Red Light
You may turn left against a red light when you are turning from a one-
way street onto a one-way street. Make sure there is no sign prohibiting
the turn. Yield to other vehicles, pedestrians, or bicyclists who have a
green light. Look both ways and turn when it is safe.
U-turns
A U-turn is when you turn your vehicle around to go back in the direction
you came. To make a U-turn, signal and use the left turn lane or far-left
lane. You may make a U-turn:
• Across a double yellow line.
• In a residential district if no vehicles are approaching you within 200
feet.
• At an intersection on a green traffic light or green arrow, unless a No
U-turn sign is posted.
• On a divided highway if a center divider opening is provided.
Never make a U-turn:
• Where a No U-turn sign is posted.
• At or on a railroad crossing.
• On a divided highway by crossing a dividing section, curb, strip of
land, or two sets of double yellow lines.
• When you cannot see clearly for 200 feet in each direction.
• On a one-way street.
• In front of a fire station. Never use a fire station driveway to turn
around.
• In business districts (the part of a city or town where most offices and
businesses are).
23
Examples of Turns
The descriptions below refer to the numbers next to the cars in the
images. Watch for pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles between your
vehicle and the curb. When making turns, there may be signs or arrows
that indicate you can turn from or end in more than one lane.
1. Left turn from a two-way street.
Start the turn in the left lane
closest to the middle of the street.
To reduce the risk of collision, end
the turn in the left lane closest to
the middle of the street going in
your vehicle’s direction.
2. Right turn. Begin and end the
turn in the lane closest to the right
edge of the road. Do not swing
wide into another lane of traffic.
3. Left turn from a two-way street
onto a one-way street. Start the
turn from the lane closest to the
middle of the street (far-left lane).
If there are three or more lanes in
your direction of travel, you may
end your turn in any lane that is
open.
4. Left turn from a one-way street
onto a two-way street. Start
the turn from the far-left lane. To
reduce the risk of collision, end the
turn in the left lane closest to the
middle of the street going in your
vehicle’s direction.

5. Left turn from a one-way street onto a
one-way street. Start the turn from the
far-left lane. Bicyclists can legally use the
left turn lane for their left turns. If there are
three or more lanes in your direction of
travel, you may end your turn in any lane
that is open.
6. Right turn from a one-way street onto a
one-way street. Start the turn in the
far-right lane. If safe, you may end the turn
in any lane.
7. Turn at a “T” intersection from
a one-way street onto a two-way
street. Traffic going straight through
the intersection has the right-of-way.
You may turn either right or left from
the center lane.
Braking
• Remove your foot from the gas pedal (accelerator) and allow the
vehicle to slow down. Lightly press the brake until you come to a full
stop. Give yourself enough space and time to perform this maneuver.
• When stopping at a limit line, do not cross over the line. If stopping
behind a vehicle, leave enough space to see their rear wheels.

25
Merging And Exiting
Merging
Highway traffic has the right-of-way. For more information, see Right-of-
Way Rules: Who Goes First in Section 7. When you enter a highway, you
will need to:
• Be in the proper lane on the on-ramp.
• Be at or near the speed of traffic.
• Merge into highway traffic when safe to do so. Do not stop unless
absolutely necessary.
• Merge into a space large enough for your vehicle to safely join the
lane.
• Use your mirrors and turn signals.
• Turn your head quickly to look over your shoulder before changing
lanes or merging into traffic.
• Make sure you can stop safely by leaving three seconds of space
between you and the vehicle in front of you.
• Do not cross over any solid lines when merging. If you need to cross
several lanes, signal and cross them one at a time. Check your blind
spots for vehicles, motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians each time.
Exiting
To exit a highway safely:
• Know your exit and be aware of when it is approaching.
• If you plan to change lanes, do so one at a time. Signal and look over
your shoulder to check your blind spots.
• When in the proper lane, signal five seconds (approximately 400 feet)
before you exit.
• Make sure you are at a safe speed to exit.
• Do not cross over any solid lines when exiting.
26
Crossing or Entering Traffic
When entering traffic from a full stop, signal and leave a large enough
space to get up to the speed of traffic. To merge, enter, or exit traffic, you
need a space that is:
• Half a block on city streets, which is about 150 feet.
• A full block on the highway, which is about 300 feet.
• Even if you have a green light, do not start across the intersection if
there are pedestrians or vehicles blocking your pathway.
When turning left, do not assume that an oncoming vehicle with its right
turn signal on is turning before it reaches you. The driver may have their
signal on by mistake or plan to turn just beyond you. Wait for the vehicle
to start its turn before beginning the left turn.
Passing
You must judge whether you have enough space to pass whenever you
approach:
• An oncoming vehicle or bicyclist.
• A hill, curve, intersection, or road obstruction. To safely pass, the hill or
curve should be at least one-third of a mile ahead.
Before you pass, look ahead for road conditions that may cause other
vehicles to move into your lane.
Do not pass:
• If you are approaching a hill or curve and cannot see if other traffic is
approaching. This is very dangerous on one and two lane roads.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection, bridge, tunnel, railroad crossing, or
other hazardous area.
• At crossroads and driveways.
• Unless you have enough space to return to your lane.
27
How to Pass
When you are going to pass on an open highway:
• Signal that you plan on passing.
• Look over your shoulder to check your blind spots.
• Drive into the passing lane.
• Speed up to pass the vehicle.
• Signal and return to your original lane.
You may pass on the right only when:
• An open highway has two or more lanes going in your direction.
• The driver ahead of you is turning left and you can safely pass on the
right. Never pass on the left if the driver is signaling a left turn.
• You are on a one-way street.
Never drive off the paved or main-traveled part of the road to pass.
Being Passed
If a vehicle is passing you or signals that they plan on passing, allow the
vehicle to pass. Maintain your lane position and your speed.
28
Parking
Parallel Parking
Parallel parking is when you park in line with the
road and other parked vehicles. To parallel park:
1. Find a space. Look for a space at least
three feet longer than your vehicle. When
you find a space, turn on your signal to
show that you plan on parking.
2. Pull up alongside the vehicle in front of
the space. Leave about two feet between
your vehicle and the vehicle next to you.
Stop once your rear bumper is aligned with
the front of your parking space. Keep your
signal on.
3. Check your blind spots. Look in your
rearview mirror and over your shoulder for
approaching vehicles and pedestrians.
4. Begin backing up. Turn your steering
wheel to back into the space at about a
45-degree angle.
5. Straighten out. Begin turning the steering
wheel away from the curb when your rear
wheel is within 18 inches of the curb. You
may need to pull forward and backward to
straighten out. Your vehicle should now be
parallel and within 18 inches of the curb.
6. Parking. Turn off your vehicle and set the
parking brake. Before you exit your vehicle,
look carefully for passing vehicles, bicycles,
and motorcycles. Exit when safe.

In general, the First Amendment protects the right of drivers and
passengers to record interactions with law enforcement in public
spaces. If you are recording, you should immediately make that clear.
You do not have a right to interfere with the officer’s lawful duties during
the enforcement stop, and you should not reach into concealed areas
to retrieve your recording device without the officer’s permission. If your
recording is not interfering with the officer’s ability to lawfully do their job,
an officer cannot confiscate your recording device, delete the recording, or
destroy the device just because you are using it to record. In general, you
also have the right to deny a request to unlock a cellular phone or provide
a password to it, though under some circumstances, such as if you are
on parole, you may have to give permission in response to such requests.
Finally, no government employee can retaliate against you just because
you recorded something in public.
Even if you believe your rights were violated, you should not engage
in physical resistance or violence against the officer. If an officer
does something that you believe violates your rights, you can voice your
objection, but you should not physically resist. Everyone has the right to
be safe during a traffic stop. Your safety and the officer’s safety could be
jeopardized if the situation escalates with physical resistance or violence.
All members of the public have a right to file a complaint against any
law enforcement agency, and it is against the law for any government
employee to retaliate against you for doing so. You can file a complaint
with the law enforcement agency that employs the officer. You
have a right to be free from discrimination based on your actual or
perceived race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, gender
identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability,
medical condition, or citizenship status. You also have other rights
guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions, as well as
California and federal laws. When you file a complaint, the agency that
employs the officer must investigate the complaint. Links to contact
information for California law enforcement agencies can be found at
post.ca.gov/le-agencies.

SECTION 7. Laws and Rules of the Road
Traffic Control
When at or approaching traffic signals or signs, yield to pedestrians,
bicyclists, and other nearby vehicles that may have the right-of-way. See
Right of Way Rules: Who Goes First, in this section.
Traffic Signals
Solid Red Light
A red traffic signal light means STOP. You can turn right at a red
light, if:
• There is not a NO TURN ON RED sign posted.
• You stop at the stop or limit line, yield for pedestrians, and turn
when it is safe.
Red Arrow
A red arrow means STOP. Do not turn at a red arrow. Remain
stopped until a green traffic signal light or green arrow appears.
Flashing Red Light
A flashing red signal light means STOP. After stopping, you may
go when it is safe.
Solid Yellow Light
A yellow traffic signal light means CAUTION. The light is about
to turn red. When you see a yellow traffic signal light, stop, if you
can do so safely. If you cannot stop safely, cautiously cross the
intersection.
Yellow Arrow
A yellow arrow means the protected turning time is ending. The
signal will change soon. If you cannot stop safely or you are
already in the intersection, cautiously complete your turn. Pay
attention to the next signal. It could be a:
• Green or red traffic signal light.
• Red arrow.
36
Flashing Yellow Light
A flashing yellow traffic signal light is a warning to PROCEED
WITH CAUTION. Slow down and be alert. You do not need to
stop.
Flashing Yellow Arrow
You can turn, but your turn is not protected from other traffic.
Proceed to turn left after yielding to oncoming traffic and
proceed with caution.
Solid Green Light
A green traffic signal light means GO. You should still stop for

proceed if you have enough space without creating a danger to
any oncoming vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian. Do not enter the
intersection if you cannot get completely across before the traffic
signal light turns red.

Right-of-Way Rules: Who Goes First?
Right-of-way rules help you understand who goes first when vehicles,
pedestrians, and bicyclists meet on the road. The vehicle that arrives to
the intersection first has the right-of-way. Other vehicles, bicyclists, and
pedestrians must wait for the person who has the right-of-way. Never
assume that other drivers will give you the right-of-way. Give up your
right-of-way when it will help prevent collisions.
Intersections
An intersection is any place where one road meets another road.
Controlled intersections have signs or traffic signal lights. Uncontrolled
and blind intersections do not. Before entering an intersection, check for
vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Be prepared to slow down and stop
if necessary. Pedestrians always have the right-of-way. Here are some
right-of-way rules at intersections:
• Without STOP or YIELD signs: The vehicle that arrives to the
intersection first has the right-of-way. However, if a vehicle, pedestrian,
or bicyclist gets to the intersection at the same time as you, give the
right-of-way to the vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist on your right. If you
approach a stop sign and there is a stop sign on all four corners, stop
first and proceed as above.
• T intersections without STOP or YIELD signs: Vehicles, bicyclists,
and pedestrians on the through road (continuing to go straight) have
the right-of-way.
• Turning left: Check for pedestrians. Give the right-of-way to any
pedestrian or approaching vehicle that is close enough to be
dangerous.
• Turning right: Always check for pedestrians crossing the street, and
motorcycles and bicycles riding next to you.
• Green traffic signal light: Proceed with caution. Pedestrians have
the right-of-way.
• Entering traffic: When entering traffic, you must proceed with
caution and yield to the traffic already occupying the lanes. It is
against the law to stop or block an intersection where there is not
enough space to completely cross before the traffic signal light turns
red.

Roundabouts
In a roundabout, traffic travels in one direction around a central island.
How to use a roundabout:
1. Slow down as you approach.
2. Yield to all traffic already in the roundabout.
3. Enter heading to the right when there is a big enough gap in traffic to
merge safely.
4. Watch for signs and lane markings that guide you.
5. Travel in a counter-clockwise direction. Do not stop or pass.
6. Signal when you change lanes or exit.
7. If you miss your exit, continue around until you return to your exit.
If the roundabout has multiple lanes, choose your entry or exit lane
based on your destination. This is shown in the image below. To:
1. Turn right (yellow car): Choose the right lane and exit in the right lane.
2. Go straight (red car): Choose either lane. Exit in the lane you entered.
3. Turn left: Enter and continue driving until you reach the exit in the
direction you choose (blue car).
